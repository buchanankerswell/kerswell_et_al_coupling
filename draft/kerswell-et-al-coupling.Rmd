keypoints:
  - The depths of antigorite destabilization and mechanical coupling are primarily dependent on backarc lithospheric thickness
  - Coupling depths in natural subduction zones can be predicted given slab age, convergence velocity, and backarc lithospheric thickness
  - Consistently high backarc heat flow in natural subduction zones may indicate a common depth of mechanical coupling globally at ca. 82 $km$
abstract: Deep mechanical coupling between converging plates is implicated in dynamic plate motions, crustal deformation, seismic cycles, arc magmatism, detachment (recovery) of subducting material, and is considered a key feature of subduction zone geodynamics. This study uses two-dimensional numerical simulations of oceanic-continental convergent margins to investigate effects of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions on coupling---specifically focusing on thermal parameter ($\Phi$) and upper-plate thickness. Numerical simulations implement coupling by including the metamorphic (de)hydration reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ in the upper-plate mantle. Visualizing PT-strain fields show thermal feedbacks regulating coupling depth dynamically with strong responses to upper-plate thickness and weak responses to $\Phi$. The results imply estimation of coupling depth is possible by inverting upper-plate thickness from surface heat flow. Moreover, surface heat flow sampled from the backarc region near 17 presently active subduction zones imply uniform upper-plate thickness, and thus uniform coupling depths among subduction zones.
plain_language_summary: Subduction is a process where two semi-rigid tectonic plates of Earth's outer shell converge, and one dives beneath the other into the mantle. Subduction zones produce the world's largest earthquakes and form new crust through volcanism. Understanding earthquakes and volcanism requires understanding how the two plates move with respect to each other. With increasing depth, the sinking plate transitions from sliding past the overriding plate to "gripping" the base of the overriding plate. This gripping (coupling) reduces earthquakes and causes warm rock to flow upwards, enabling volcanism. We used two-dimensional computer simulations of subduction to test what controls the depth of coupling between the plates. We found that coupling depth is primarily controlled by the thickness of the overriding plate and provide an equation to predict coupling depth in natural subduction zones. Overriding plates in subduction zones worldwide appear to have similar thicknesses, so coupling depths are also predicted to be similar. We do not yet fully understand why the overriding plates are uniformly thin globally, but perhaps this is related to hydration and melting under volcanic arcs.

# Introduction

Subduction geodynamics are largely defined by plate motions and mechanical behavior along the plate interface. For example, a transition from mechanically decoupled (plates moving differentially with respect to each other) to coupled plates (plates moving with the same local velocity) dramatically increases temperature by inducing mantle circulation in the upper-plate asthenospheric mantle [@peacock1994; @peacock1996]. Observations from numerical simulations and forearc surface heat flow imply coupling transitions occur globally within a narrow range of depths in modern subduction zones (70-80 km). Further, coupling appears essentially unresponsive to diverse thermo-kinematic boundary conditions, including oceanic plate age, convergence velocity, and subduction geometry [@furukawa1993; @wada2008; @wada2009]. While uniform coupling depths among subduction zones are inferred from numerical simulations and surface heat flow, this phenomenon remains curious and unconfirmed to a large extent. To understand subduction zone geodynamics, it is essential to understand why modern subduction zones appear to achieve similar coupling depths despite differences in their physical characteristics.

Notwithstanding, many numerical geodynamic models use coupling depths of 70-80 km as a boundary condition [@abers2017; @currie2004; @syracuse2010; @vankeken2011; @vankeken2018; @wada2012; @gao2014; @wilson2014], although not exclusively [e.g. 40-56 km, @england2010; @peacock1996]. Similar coupling depths among subduction zones is an attractive hypothesis for at least two reasons. First, it helps explain a relatively narrow range of depths to subducting oceanic plates beneath volcanic arcs [@england2004; @syracuse2006] as mechanical coupling is expected to be closely associated with the onset of flux melting. Second, mechanical coupling is required to detach crustal fragments from the subducting plate [@agard2016], so uniform coupling depths may also help explain why maximum pressures recorded by subducted oceanic material worldwide is $\leq$ 2.3-2.5 GPa [roughly 80 km, @agard2009; @agard2018].

The location and extent of mechanical coupling along the plate interface is implicated in myriad geodynamic phenomena, including seismicity, metamorphism, volatile flux, volcanism, plate motions, and crustal deformation [@cizkova2013; @gonzalez2016; @hirauchi2010; @peacock1990; @peacock1991; @peacock1993; @peacock1996; @peacock1999a; @hacker2003; @vankeken2011; @grove2012; @gao2017]. Consequently, the mechanics of coupling have been extensively studied and discussed. Coupling fundamentally depends on the strength (viscosity) of materials above, within, and below the plate interface. Water flux from compaction and dehydration of hydrous minerals with increasing PT forms layers of low viscosity sheet silicates near the plate interface. Transmission of shear stress between plates is inhibited by formation of talc and serpentine in the shallow upper-plate mantle [@peacock1999a]. Lack of traction along the interface, combined with cooling from the subducting plate surface, ensures a positive feedback between hydrous mineral formation and mechanical decoupling. Experimentally determined flow laws, petrologic observations, and geophysical observations all support the plausibility of this conceptual model of subduction interface behavior [e.g. @agard2016; @agard2018; @gao2014; @peacock1999a].

Experimental control over important thermo-kinematic boundary conditions make geodynamic numerical simulations essential for investigating such complex geodynamic environments. @wada2009 previously investigated the effects of $\Phi$ on coupling depths by numerically simulating 17 presently active subduction zones. Among other thermo-kinematic boundary conditions, their models specify convergence rate, subduction geometry, thermal structure of oceanic- and overriding-plates, and degree of coupling along the subduction interface. Notably, their experiments control for interface rheology and discriminate best-fit coupling depths based on observed forearc surface heat flow.

This study similarly specifies thermo-kinematic boundary conditions to numerically simulate the range of modern subduction zone systems, but regulates interface rheology dynamically by implementing metamorphic reactions that respond to evolving PT-strain fields. Subduction geometry and coupling depth are not fully determined features, in other words, but spontaneous model outcomes within the range of specified boundary conditions discussed in Section \@ref(numMethods). As in previous studies [e.g. @ruh2015], rheological effects of the dehydration reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ are implemented to drive mechanical coupling. An abrupt viscosity increase accompanies antigorite (serpentine) destabilization, thereby inducing mechanical coupling, as defined by empirically-determined flow laws used in the numerical experiments.

This chapter focuses on two fundamental questions. How does coupling depth respond to $\Phi$ *and* upper-plate thickness? And how stable is coupling depth through time? First, 64 convergent margins with variable upper-plate thickness and $\Phi$ are numerically simulated and mechanical plate coupling is observed. Thermal feedbacks within the system are visualized in terms of mantle temperature, viscosity, and velocity fields and coupling depth responses to a range of $\Phi$ and upper-plate thickness are quantified using multivariate linear regression. Three different regression models are then used to estimate coupling depths for 17 presently active subduction zones. Coupling depth estimates are narrowly distributed, regardless of regression model form. Finally, implications and questions regarding uniformity among subduction zones in terms of surface heat flow, upper-plate thickness, and coupling depth are discussed.

# Numerical Modelling Methods {#numMethods}

This study simulates converging oceanic-continental plates, where an ocean basin is being consumed by subduction at a continental margin (Figure \@ref(fig:init)). Initial conditions are modified from previous numerical experiments of active margins [@sizova2010; @gorczyk2007] using the code `I2VIS` [@gerya2003], although plate coupling was not the focus of their studies. An identical rheologic model with identical material properties (Table \@ref(tab:materials)), and a identical hydration/melt model (Table \@ref(tab:melts) & Appendix \@ref(deHydration)) to @sizova2010 are implemented. However, the version of `I2VIS` in this study differs from @sizova2010 in its initial setup, overall dimension, resolution, continental geotherm, dehydration model, and left boundary condition (origin of new oceanic lithosphere). Differences are outlined in this section and in Appendix \@ref(deHydration). Sixty-four `I2VIS` models constructed with varying convergence rates ($\vec{v}$), oceanic plate ages, and upper-plate thickness (Figure \@ref(fig:params)) were ran for at least 100 timesteps.


\begin{landscape}


(ref:initCap) Initial model configuration and boundary conditions. (a) A free sedimentation/erosion boundary at the surface is maintained by implementing a layer of "sticky" air and water, and an infinite-like open boundary at the bottom allows for spontaneous oceanic plate descent and subduction angle. Left and right boundaries are free slip and thermally insulating. Initial material distribution includes 7 km of oceanic crust (2 km basalt, 5 km gabbro), 1 km of oceanic sediments, and 35 km of continental crust, thinning ocean-ward. (b) Oceanic lithosphere is continually created at the left boundary. The oceanic geotherm is calculated using a half-space cooling model and the continental geotherm is calculated using a one-dimensional steady-state conductive cooling model to 1300 ˚C. The base of the upper-plate lithosphere ($Z_{UP}$) is defined by visualizing viscosity and generally coincides with the 1100 ˚C isotherm. (c) Oceanic crust is bent under loading from passive margin sediments, and a weak zone extends through the lithosphere to help induce subduction. Convergence velocities are imposed at stationary, high-viscosity regions far from the trench. Rock type colors are: [1] air, [2] water, [4,5] sediments, [6,7] felsic crust, [8] basalt, [9] gabbro, [10,11] dry mantle, [12] hydrated mantle, [14] serpentinized mantle.

## Initial Setup and Boundary Conditions {#numBCs}

Simulations are 2000 km wide and 300 km deep (Figure \@ref(fig:init)). In the model domain, three governing equations of heat transport, momentum, and continuity are discretized and solved with a conservative finite-difference marker-in-cell approach on a fully staggered grid as outlined in @gerya2003. Numerical resolution is nonuniform with higher resolution (1 $\times$ 1 km) in a 600 km wide area surrounding the contact between the oceanic plate and continental margin, then gradually changing to lower resolution towards the model boundaries (5 $\times$ 1 km, x- and z-directions, respectively). The left and right boundaries are free-slip and thermally insulating (Figure \@ref(fig:init)a, b). Implementation of "sticky" air and water allows for a free topographical surface with a simple linear sedimentation and erosion model. The lower boundary is open to allow for oceanic plate descent with a spontaneous subduction angle [@burg2005].

(ref:paramsCap) Range of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions used in numerical experiments. (a) Thermal parameters (grayscale) range from 13 to 110 km/100 and broadly reflect the distribution of oceanic plate ages and convergence velocities in modern subduction zones. Model names include the prefix "cd" for "coupling depth" with increasing alphabetic suffixes. Note that neither axes are continuous. (b) Upper-plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) is defined by a range of continental geotherms. Geotherms were constructed using a one-dimensional steady-state conductive cooling model with T(z=0) = 0 ˚C, $\vec{q}$(z=0) = 59, 63, 69, 79 mW/m$^2$, and constant radiogenic heating of 1.0 $\mu$W/m$^3$ for a 35 km-thick crust and 0.022 $\mu$W/m$^3$ for the mantle. Continental geotherms are calculated up to 1300 ˚C with a constant 0.5 ˚C/km gradient (the mantle adiabat) extending to the base of the model domain.

A horizontal convergence force is applied to both plates in a rectangular region far from the continental margin (Figure \@ref(fig:init)c). An initial weak layer cutting the lithosphere permits subduction to initiate. The high-viscosity ($\eta = 10^{25}$ Pa $\cdot$ s) rectangular convergence regions apply constant horizontal velocities without deforming the lithosphere. Subduction angle is governed by free-motion of the subducting plate. Similarly, subduction velocity varies with time in response to extension or shortening of the overriding plate. $\Phi$ is thus calculated as the product of the horizontal convergence velocity and the oceanic plate age [cf. @kirby1991; @mckenzie1969]. For convenience and consistency with the literature, this study presents $\Phi$ in units of km/100 (Figure \@ref(fig:params)a).

## Rheologic Model {#rheologicModel}

Contributions from dislocation and diffusion creep are accounted for by computing a composite rheology for ductile rocks, $\eta_{eff}$:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{\eta_{eff}} = \frac{1}{\eta_{diff}} + \frac{1}{\eta_{disl}}
  \end{aligned} 
  (\#eq:ductile)
\end{equation}
where $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are effective viscosities for diffusion and dislocation creep.

\noindent For the crust and serpentinized mantle, $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are computed as:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \eta_{diff} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A \ \sigma_{crit}^{1-n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{RT}\right] \\
    \eta_{disl} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A^{1/n} \ \dot{\varepsilon}_{II}^{(1-n)/n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{nRT}\right]
  (\#eq:crust)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the gas constant, $P$ is pressure, $T$ is temperature in $K$, ${\dot{\varepsilon}}_{II} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}{{\dot{\varepsilon}}_{ij}}^{2}}$ is the square root of the second invariant of the strain rate tensor, $\sigma_{crit}$ is an assumed diffusion-dislocation transition stress, and $A$, $E$, $V$ and $n$ are the material constant, activation energy, activation volume, and stress exponent, respectively [Table \@ref(tab:materials), @hilairet2007; @ranalli1995].

\noindent For the mantle, $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are computed as [@karato1993]:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \eta_{diff} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A^{-1} \ G \ \left[\frac{h}{b}\right]^{m/n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{RT}\right] \\
    \eta_{disl} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A^{-1/n} \ G \ \dot{\varepsilon}_{II}^{(1-n)/n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{nRT}\right]
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:mantle)
\end{equation}
where $b$ = 5 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ m is the Burgers vector, $G$ = 8 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ Pa is shear modulus, $h$ = 1 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ m is the assumed grain size, $m$ = 2.5 is the grain size exponent, and the other flow law parameters are given in Table \@ref(tab:materials). Viscosity is limited in all numerical experiments from $\eta_{min}$ = 10$^{17}$ Pa $\cdot$ s to $\eta_{max}$ = 10$^{25}$ Pa $\cdot$ s.

\noindent An effective visco-plastic rheology is achieved by limiting $\eta_{eff}$ with a brittle (plastic) yield criterion:
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{eff} \leq \frac{C + \phi \ P}{2 \ \dot{\varepsilon}_{II}}
  (\#eq:plastic)
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is the internal friction coefficient, $C$ cohesive strength at $P$ = 0, and ${\dot{\varepsilon}}_{ij}$ is the strain rate tensor (Table \@ref(tab:materials)).

## Defining Geotherms and Lithospheric Thickness {#numGeotherms}

Oceanic crust is modelled as 1 km of sediment cover overlying 2 km of basalt and 5 km of gabbro (Figure \@ref(fig:init)a). Oceanic lithosphere is continually made at a pseudo-mid-ocean ridge at the left boundary of the model (Figure \@ref(fig:init)b). An enhanced vertical cooling condition applied at 200 km from left boundary adjusts for the proper oceanic plate age, and therefore its lithospheric thickness as it enters the trench [@agrusta2013]. Oceanic plate ages range from 32.6 to 110 Ma and convergence velocities from 40 to 100 km/Ma (Figure \@ref(fig:params)a). This range of parameters broadly reflects the middle-range of modern global subduction systems [@syracuse2006].

Initial continental geotherms are determined by solving the heat flow equation in one-dimension to 1300 ˚C (Figure \@ref(fig:params)b). This study assumes a fixed temperature of 0 ˚C at the surface, constant radiogenic heating of 1 $\mu$W/m$^3$ in the 35 km-thick continental crust, 0.022 $\mu$W/m$^3$ in the mantle, with thermal conductivities of 2.3 W/mK and 3.0 W/mK for the continental crust and mantle, respectively. Above, 1300 ˚C, temperature is assumed to constantly increase by 0.5 ˚C/km (the mantle adiabat) to the base of the model domain.

Many studies define the base of the continental lithosphere at the 1300 ˚C isotherm, but it can be determined directly by visualizing viscosity and strain rate as the model progresses. The mechanical base of the lithosphere ($Z_{UP}$) in the models generally occurs near the 1100 ˚C isotherm---characterized by a rapid decrease in viscosity and increase in strain rate (Figures \@ref(fig:cdfStep1), \@ref(fig:cdfStep2), \@ref(fig:cdfStep3)). As such, this study considers oceanic and continental lithospheres as mechanical layers defined by viscosity, rather than defined merely by temperature. $Z_{UP}$ corresponding to backarc surface heat flow of 59, 63, 69, and 79 mW/m$^2$ are used in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:params)b).

## Metamorphic (De)hydration Reactions {#numHydration}

Using Lagrangian markers [@harlow1962; @harlow1964] to store and update material properties and PT-strain fields allows for straight-forward numerical implementation of metamorphic reactions. This approach is key to regulating mechanical coupling dynamically in subduction zone simulations. For example, dehydration (eclogitization) of the oceanic plate and (de)stabilization of serpentine in the upper-plate mantle may be effectively modelled by tracing marker PT-time paths while changing marker properties according to thermodynamically-stable mineral assemblages [e.g. @connolly2005]. For computational efficiency, however, water contents in this study are not computed by iteratively solving thermodynamic systems of equations.

Instead, gradual eclogitization of oceanic crust is computed as a linear function of lithostatic pressure to a maximum depth of 150 km, or temperature of 1427 ˚C, while including garnet-in and plagioclase-out reactions defined by @ito1971. Mantle (de)hydration is computed according reactions boundaries defined by @schmidt1998 with a maximum water content of 2 $wt.\%$ (explained below). This approach effectively simulates continuous influx of water to the upper-plate mantle with relatively low computational cost, beginning with compaction and release of connate water at shallow depths, followed by a sequence of reactions consuming major hydrous phases (chlorite, lawsonite, zoisite, chloritoid, talc, amphibole, and phengite) in different parts of the hydrated basaltic crust [@schmidt1998; @vankeken2011].

The extent of metamorphic reaction effects on mechanical coupling, and the exact (de)hydration reaction(s) likely responsible, are unknown. However, formation of brucite and serpentine from dry olivine near the plate interface are inferred to strongly regulate mechanical behavior [@hyndman2003; @peacock1999a; @agard2016]. Brucite notably breaks down at much lower temperatures than serpentine [@schmidt1998], so serpentine (de)stabilization arguably represents the key transition from a weak-to-strong upper-plate mantle deep in subduction zones. This study elects an implementation of serpentine (de)hydration for this reason. The reaction is assumed to be abrupt and discontinuous, which is a fine approximation for near-endmember compositions like (Mg-rich) peridotites. The PT conditions of the reaction $antigorite \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ were numerically implemented by the following equation [after @schmidt1998]:
\begin{equation}
  T_{atg-out}(z)=
  \begin{cases}
    751.50+6.008\times10^{-3}z-3.469\times10^{-8}z^2,& \text{for } z < 63000m \\
    1013.2-6.039\times10^{-5}z-4.289\times10{-9}z^2,& \text{for } z>63000m
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:antstab)
\end{equation}
where $z$ is the depth of a marker from the surface in meters and $T$ is temperature in Kelvins. This reaction boundary is consistent to within 25 ˚C of more recent experiments by @shen2015. Markers with internal temperature exceeding $T_{atg-out}(z)$ spontaneously form $olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ and release their crystal-bound water. This implementation tacitly assumes thermodynamic equilibrium and is common to many versions of `I2VIS`.

Oceanic plates of different ages are also tacitly assumed to dehydrate similarly with the above implementation. However, older (colder) oceanic plates are expected to carry water to greater depths than younger (warmer) plates because of relatively delayed water-releasing reactions [@peacock1996]. Abrupt water release with serpentine dehydration (Equation \@ref(eq:antstab)) was tested to model deep water retention in cold oceanic plates. Mechanical coupling behavior was indistinguishable from gradual water release models. This implies rates of water release are less important than the depth of serpentine stability. Explicitly modelling other major dehydration reactions are thus unlikely to significantly affect mechanical coupling behavior, yet likely to introduce numerical artifacts at great computational cost. A simplified gradual water release model for all oceanic plates is therefore preferred.

Water released by rock forms discrete fluid particles that migrate with relative velocities defined by local deviatoric (non-lithostatic) pressure gradients [see Appendix \@ref(deHydration), @faccenda2009]. Fluid velocities are scaled by a 10 cm/yr vertical percolation velocity to account for purely lithostatic pressure gradients in the mantle [@gorczyk2007]. Fluid particles migrate until encountering rock that can consume additional water by equilibrium hydration or melting reactions, (Equation \@ref(tab:melts)).

The shallow upper-plate mantle can theoretically store large amounts of water as serpentine may contain up to 13 $wt.\%$ water [@reynard2013] and is generally stable at shallow mantle conditions. Thermodynamic models predict 8 $wt.\%$ water in the shallow upper-plate mantle [@connolly2005]. However, seismic studies suggest most shallow upper-plate mantles are only partially serpentinized (< 20-40%), equating to water contents of approximately 3-6 $wt.\%$ [@abers2017; @carlson2003]. Many modes of mantle hydration are documented or inferred, including evidence for channelized fluid flow within ophiolites exhumed from subduction zones [@angiboust2012a; @angiboust2014a; @zack2007; @plumper2017]. This study limits mantle wedge hydration to $\leq$ 2 $wt.\%~H_{2}O$ and assumes any excess $H_{2}O$ exits the system through channelized fluid flow during plastic or brittle deformation [@davies1999a].

## Visualization and Determination of Coupling Depth

The rheologic model and thermo-kinematic boundary conditions described in the previous sections always results in plate motions towards the left boundary (slab-rollback). Relatively high dip angles and extreme subduction velocities in some high-$\Phi$ experiments cause chaotic behavior by 10 Ma as the upper-plate is stretched thin and mechanical interference occurs between trench sediments and the high-viscosity convergence region 200 km from the left boundary. Numerical solutions are stable for most experiments, however, reaching quasi-steady state by 5 Ma. An additional 5 Ma is allowed to ensure stable geodynamics before observing coupling depth. Surface heat flow, rock type, temperature, viscosity, strain rate, shear heating, and velocity fields are visualized at approximately 10 Ma (e.g. Figure \@ref(fig:comp)) for all 64 experiments to assess geodynamics and solution stability (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)).

(ref:compCap) Visualizing model cdf with a 78 km upper-plate lithosphere at approximately 10 Ma. (a) Rock type shows a thin serpentine layer (pink) lubricating the plate interface. Note that low melt volumes are inconspicuous and quickly extracted. (b) Viscosity shows high contrast between the oceanic plate and serpentinized upper-plate mantle at shallow levels. Viscosity contrast disappears where serpentine becomes unstable. (c) Streamlines show focused mantle flow towards the interface, coinciding with the lower limit of serpentine stability. Note the converging isotherms that imply a feedback between heat transfer, serpentine destabilization, and mechanical coupling. (d) Strain rate shows localized deformation in the serpentine layer along the plate interface. Note that deformation in the upper-plate mantle is restricted to viscous flow beneath the lithosphere and along narrow, subvertical melt conduits. Rock type colors are the same as Figure \@ref(fig:init).

```

After approximately 10 Ma of subduction coupling depth is determined directly from viscosity by finding the approximate area where strength contrasts between serpentinized- and non-serpentinized upper-plate mantle diminishes to < 10$^2$ Pa $\cdot$ s. The node nearest to this region is assigned as the coupling depth. This study assumes mechanical coupling occurs instantaneously and at a single node. Mechanical coupling in reality must be dispersed across a finite length along the plate interface, however. At the numerical resolution the experiments, coupling-like viscosity contrasts are similar within a small area (approximately 5 $\times$ 5 km or 5 $\times$ 5 nodes), giving a qualitative uncertainty coupling depth on the order of 2.5 km.

Coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) correlates strongly with upper-plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) and weakly with $\Phi$ across all 64 numerical models (Table \@ref(tab:zcResults), Figures \@ref(fig:results) & \@ref(fig:biv)). The responsiveness of coupling depth to $Z_{UP}$ but not to $\Phi$ is a key result of this study. The following equation minimizes standard least squares while optimizing the number of parameters, *p value*, and $R^2$ for all possible permutations of the variables $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ in linear and quadratic forms:
\begin{equation}
  Z_{cpl} = 4.95\times 10^{-3}\ Z_{UP}^{2}\ -\ 9.27\times 10^{-2}\ \Phi\ +\ 63.6
  (\#eq:zCpl)
\end{equation}
where $Z_{cpl}$ is coupling depth in km and $\Phi$ is the thermal parameter in km/100. Regression summaries show both linear and quadratic models of $Z_{cpl}$ vs. $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ fit experimental results well (Tables \@ref(tab:anova) & \@ref(tab:regSummary)). Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) represents a statistical model formulated with observations from physics-based simulations of subduction. Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) is useful for estimating coupling depths in active subduction zones where $\Phi$ is known and $Z_{UP}$ can be inverted from surface heat flow.

Sensitivity of coupling depth to upper-plate thickness and $\Phi$ is apparent when visualizing Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) and other regression models across $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ space \@ref(fig:multiv). Applying Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) to 17 active subduction zone segments (Table \@ref(tab:segs)) gives a wide range of estimated coupling depths, similar to the numerical simulations in this study. The distribution of estimated coupling depths, however, is relatively narrow and quasi-normal, with a mean of $\sim$ 82 km and standard deviation of 7 km (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d).

(ref:multivCap) Multivariate regressions and estimated coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) for 17 active subduction zone segments. Contoured plots show estimated $Z_{cpl}$ (contours) as a function of thermal parameter ($\Phi$) and upper-plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) for linear (a) and quadratic (b, c) regressions. The best fit regression is panel b (Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl), see Tables \@ref(tab:anova) and \@ref(tab:regSummary)). Black squares are numerical experiments used to fit the contours. White points represent active subduction zones (Table \@ref(tab:segs)). Contours imply $Z_{cpl}$ depends strongly on $Z_{UP}$. While some estimated $Z_{cpl}$ for subduction zones with similar $\Phi$ are quite different (e.g. Alaska vs. N. Sumatra), some estimated $Z_{cpl}$ are quite similar for subduction zones with very different $\Phi$ (e.g. Kamchatka vs. N. Cascadia). (d) Distributions of estimated $Z_{cpl}$ for 17 active subduction zones shown in (a), (b), and (c). These 17 segments span a large range of $\Phi$ but are expected to have a relatively narrow distribution of $Z_{cpl}$ (82 $\pm$ 14 km) according to the regressions in (a), (b), and (c).

## Surface Heat Flow

Upper-plate surface heat flow remains relatively stable and reflects initial upper-plate geotherms in the backarc region for experiments with low to moderate $\Phi$ (Figure \@ref(fig:hf)). However, high-amplitude and high-frequency positive surface heat flow deviations in the upper-plate are common in all experiments, especially for high-$\Phi$ experiments. These deviations correspond to extensional deformation and heat transport via lithospheric thinning and melt migration. These features are apparent as subvertical low viscosity, high strain rate columns originating from the plate interface (Figure \@ref(fig:comp)b, d) and point to potential sources of error when inverting surface heat flow in active subduction zones. Notably, the backarc is relatively unaffected by fluid and melt migration compared to the forearc. Estimating upper-plate thickness by inverting surface heat flow in the backarc is therefore preferable to forearc surface heat flow.

Surface heat flow across all numerical experiments is similar in the forearc region (normalized distance $\leq$ 0.75, Figure \@ref(fig:hf78)). In contrast, surface heat flow extending behind the arc region (normalized distance > 0.75, Figure \@ref(fig:hf78)) increases systematically, then levels off at values reflecting initial continental geotherms (i.e. reflecting initial upper-plate thickness). In reality, surface heat flow depend on fault slip rates and rates of volcanic outputs. However, heat flow in the behind the arc may remain in steady-state if rates of volcanism and crustal thinning by extension are low [@currie2004; @currie2006].

(ref:hf78Cap) Surface heat flow ($\vec{q}$) vs. normalized distance for model cdf with upper-plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) ranging from 46 to 94 km. The distribution of $\vec{q}$ in the forearc (normalized distance between 0.0 and 1.0) is narrow and shows little variance until near the arc (normalized distance between 0.75 and 1.0). The broad distribution of $\vec{q}$ behind the arc (normalized distance > 1.0) reflects the broad distribution of initial continental geotherms ($Z_{UP}$). Any simple relationship between $\vec{q}$ and $Z_{UP}$ may be obscured by heating from extension or vertical migration of fluids, especially within the arc-region (high-amplitude fluctuations).

# Discussion {#Discussion}

## Dynamic Feedbacks Regulating Plate Coupling

A clear association between plate coupling and the reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ is observed in all experiments. A relatively narrow serpentine channel quickly forms above the dehydrating oceanic plate, localizing strain, lubricating the plate interface, and inhibiting transfer of shear stress between plates [e.g. @agard2016; @ruh2015]. This mechanical behavior is a direct consequence of a sharp rheologic change dependent on the location of serpentine dehydration reaction described in Section \@ref(numHydration) and its effect on the rheologic model described in Section \@ref(rheologicModel). Interactions among viscosity changes, serpentine dehydration, and heat transfer are regulated by competing dynamic feedbacks acting in the upper-plate. In summary, cooling and hydration of the shallow upper-plate mantle (serpentine stabilization) and heating from circulating asthenospheric mantle beneath the upper-plate lithosphere (driven by mechanical coupling) compete to stabilize coupling depth (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)).

(ref:flowCap) Visualizing viscosity and mantle flow near the coupling region at approximately 10 Ma for model cdf with upper-plate thickness of 78 km. (a) Temperature field. (b) Strong mantle flow beneath the lithospheric base (1100˚C) transfers heat towards the coupling region. Viscosity indicates coupling at the point where the viscosity contrast between the slab and mantle approaches zero (between points b & d). Reference points a-e are used for discussing coupling dynamics and thermal feedbacks (see Section \@ref(cplResponses)).

```{r flow, fig.cap='(ref:flowCap)', fig.scap='Visualizing viscosity and mantle flow'}

knitr::include_graphics('assets/figs/fig6.png')

```

The entire process can be conceptualized with Figure \@ref(fig:flow) as follows. The upper-plate mantle cools via diffusive heat loss to the oceanic plate along the entire length of the plate interface (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)a). At shallow depths, water released from the oceanic plate stabilizes serpentine in the overriding upper-plate mantle, effectively decoupling the two plates (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point a). A positive feedback stabilizes serpentine to greater depths as decoupled plates stagnate the upper-plate mantle, promoting further cooling and formation of serpentine. Numerical experiments imply only a thin layer of serpentine is sufficient to trigger this feedback.

Deeper along the plate interface, beyond the stability of serpentine, diffusive heat loss from the upper-plate mantle to the slab forms a thickening layer of high-viscosity mantle atop the oceanic plate (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point b). Downward motion of the oceanic plate, plus accreted high-viscosity mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point b) relative to the deepest extent of the stiff upper-plate mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point c) creates a pressure gradient that attracts flow of the weakest materials---serpentine from the up-dip direction (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point d)---and hot mantle from below (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point e). Flow of hot mantle into the necking region between points b and c in Figure \@ref(fig:flow) is analogous to passive asthenospheric upwelling toward a mid-ocean ridge where two strong cooling lithospheric plates diverge. Highly efficient heat advection from the warm upper-plate asthenospheric mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)a) prevents formation of sperentine---thus regulating and stabilizing the coupling depth.

Coupling mechanics apparent from numerical experiments can be described in terms of competing positive and negative feedbacks. The positive feedback involves addition of water into a diffusively cooling, shallow mantle to produce serpentine. The negative feedback involves serpentine destabilization by advection of heat from the deeper upper-plate asthenospheric mantle. Such thermal-petrologic-mechanical feedbacks drive coupling depth towards steady-state. The numerical experiments in this study imply a finely-tuned balance of serpentine stability can maintain coupling depths in subduction zones for potentially 10's of Ma.

## Coupling Responses to $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ {#cplResponses}

How does upper-plate thickness influence coupling depth? Numerical experiments point to the upper-plate lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary as an important feature constraining coupling mechanics as it defines the permissible flow field in the upper-plate (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)a-d). Thin upper-plate lithospheres (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)a, b) permit shallow mantle flow and advection of heat farther up the plate interface. Thin upper-plate lithospheres thereby raise coupling depths by raising serpentine stability up the plate interface. Thick upper-plate lithospheres (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)c, d) restrict mantle wedge flow to deeper levels, deepening serpentine stability and mechanical coupling.

The thermal state of the slab, as represented by $\Phi$, has almost no effect on coupling depth by comparison. Relative insensitivity of coupling depth to $\Phi$ is consistent with previous studies of active subduction zones [@furukawa1993; @wada2009]. The irresponsiveness of coupling depth to changes in $\Phi$ is perhaps  due to competing cooling and heating effects driven by the subducting oceanic plate. For example, high-$\Phi$ oceanic plates (older plates with higher velocities) cool the upper-plate mantle more effectively, but also effectively heat the interface by driving stronger mantle circulation. In contrast, low-$\Phi$ oceanic plates (younger plates with lower velocities) are less effective in cooling the upper-plate mantle, but also ineffectively heat the interface by ineffectively driving mantle circulation. That is, the shallow vs. deep dynamic effects of $\Phi$ tend to cancel each other, explaining the lack of correlation between coupling depth and $\Phi$.

## Estimating Coupling Depths in Subduction Zones

Theoretically, coupling depth can be estimated directly by fitting forearc surface heat flow data using forward modelling approaches [e.g. @wada2009]. However, forward approaches typically adjust coupling depth independently from upper-plate thickness, which is inconsistent with an inherent link between coupling depth and upper-plate thickness discussed in Section \@ref(Discussion) (e.g. Figures \@ref(fig:hf78) & \@ref(fig:streams)). Moreover, many additional heat sources [e.g. shear heating and crustal plutonism, @gao2014; @reesjones2018] may contribute to forearc surface heat flow---increasing uncertainty when inverting upper-plate thickness from surface heat flow.

Assuming low degrees of backarc extension, estimating coupling depth in active subduction zones using Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) with $Z_{UP}$ inverted from backarc surface heat flow is preferable to avoid additional uncertainties stemming from seismic and volcanic activity in the forearc. However, while $\Phi$ is inventoried for most active subduction zones [@syracuse2006], a corresponding dataset of $Z_{UP}$ does not exist. Several geophysical and petrologic methods might be considered for independent estimates of $Z_{UP}$ (e.g. seismic velocities, flexure, heat flow, mantle xenoliths). Backarc surface heat flow is still a good choice, however, because of its direct correspondence with $Z_{UP}$. For example, $Z_{UP}$ may be estimated using simple one-dimensional heat transport models assuming values for radiogenic heat production in the crust [@rudnick1998]. Special attention must be paid to crustal processes, including extension and magmatism, because additional heating will underestimate $Z_{UP}$ and, consequently, underestimate coupling depth.

(ref:streamsCap) Visualizing mantle flow at approximately 10 Ma for model cdf with upper-plate thickness of (a) 46, (b) 62, (c) 78, and (d) 94 km. All experiments are plotted on the same scale and location within the model domain. The flow of warm mantle is restricted to below the 1100˚C isotherm, which corresponds to the base of the upper-plate lithosphere ($Z_{UP}$). A minimum coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) appears to exist as models with extremely thin lithospheres (a) exhibit coupling at $\sim$ 70-80 km depth. $Z_{cpl}$ generally increases with increasing $Z_{UP}$ as mantle flow and advective heat transport are restricted to greater depths.

## Globally Similar Coupling Depths?

A $Z_{cpl}$ distribution of 82 $\pm$ 14 km (2$\sigma$) estimated for active subduction zones in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d) roughly match the preferred $Z_{cpl}$ inferred from forearc surface heat flow for Cascadia and NE Japan [75-80 km, @syracuse2010; @wada2009] km. The range of $Z_{cpl}$ estimated for active subduction zones in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d) is relatively broad, however. For example, omitting Mexico and Nankai because their $\Phi$ values fall outside the range of $\Phi$ used for numerical experiments, estimated coupling depths range from almost 100 km (Kyushu) to approximately 65 km (Sumatra and NE Japan, Table \@ref(tab:segs)).

Coupling depth in active subduction zones are commonly assumed to be narrowly distributed around 70-80 km [@wada2009; @syracuse2010]. The strong correlation between $Z_{UP}$ and $Z_{cpl}$ found from numerical experiments imply uniform coupling depths are possible if upper-plate thickness are globally uniform. The surface heat flow dataset compiled by @wada2009 (Table \@ref(tab:segs)) shows average backarc surface heat flow are indeed similar among active subduction zones---implying a narrow distribution of coupling depths (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d). Much of their dataset is based on @currie2006, who estimate upper-plate thickness for 10 circum-Pacific subduction zones of 50-60 km (defined by the 1200 ˚C isotherm). Uniformly thin upper-plate thickness are corroborated by uniformly high heat flow (> 70 mW/m$^2$), thermobarometric constraints on mantle xenoliths, and P-wave velocities [@currie2006]. An attempt is made to further corroborate the uniformity of upper-plate thickness in Chapter \@ref(chpt3) by interpolating surface heat flow near active subduction zones.

Although it still curious why upper-plates among subduction zones may have similar thicknesses, one can assume it is likely related to some processes of lithospheric erosion proposed for subarc lithosphere. These include: lithospheric delamination induced by lower crust eclogitization [@sobolev2005], small-scale convection caused by hydration-induced mantle wedge weakening [@arcay2006], thermal erosion [@england2010], mechanical weakening by percolating melts [@gerya2011], and subarc foundering of magmatic cumulates [@jull2001]. Most of these mechanisms are thus strongly related to mantle wedge hydration, melting, and melt transport toward volcanic arcs.

The metamorphic rock record may also imply consistency among coupling depths in subduction zones. For example, the demise of a serpentine channel and onset of coupling may provide a natural barrier such that rocks are more likely to be exhumed from within the channel than from below it. The relative abundance of blueschists and eclogites should then be greater for pressures below estimated coupling depths (approximately 2.4 GPa or 70-80 km) than above them. 

# Conclusions

Three important results are highlighted in this study:

1. Coupling depth is stabilized near the base of the upper-plate lithosphere by competing dynamic feedbacks regulating heat transport, serpentine dehydration, and mechanical coupling in the upper-plate mantle.
2. A simple expression fitted to coupling depths observed in numerical experiments allows the coupling depths to be estimated for active subduction zones by inverting upper-plate thickness from surface heat flow.
3. Uniform surface heat flow in circum-Pacific subduction zones [@currie2006; @wada2009] may indicate uniform coupling depths at approximately 80 km.

Questions remain, however, including: how do warm (thin) upper-plates persist over 100's of kilometers behind arcs and throughout the lifespan of subduction zones? How abruptly are dehydration reaction occurring along the subduction interface? How can expressions like Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) be improved using natural datasets? Each of these questions may be considered for future research.

# Serpentine Stability Depth Through Time {#antDepth}

Stability of serpentine progressively increases with depth along the plate interface as the subducting oceanic plate continuously cools and hydrates the shallow upper-plate mantle. However, this phenomenon ceases after approximately 5 Ma and dynamics change. From approximately 5 Ma to tens of Ma afterwards, the lower limit of serpentine dehydration stabilizes (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)). In theory, serpentine dehydration should continue to increase as long as water continues to flux from the oceanic plate and the shallow upper-plate remains stagnant and cooling. Stability of serpentine dehydration through tens of Ma is direct result of the correspondence between mechanical coupling and absence of serpentine along the plate interface. Notably, using Lagrangian frameworks to implement metamorphic reactions is an advantageous numerical feature allowing for such behavior.

```{r antDepth, fig.cap='Serpentine stability depth at the plate interface vs. time for models cda, cdf, and cdp with $Z_{UP}$ = 46, 62, 78, and 94 km. Serpentine stabilization deepens for approximately 5 Ma of subduction and then remains roughly constant for $\\leq$ 10 Ma. The exceptions are models with very thin $Z_{UP}$, which exhibit transient behavior for at least 15 Ma. Overall serpentine stability depth after approximately 5 Ma depends on upper-plate thickness.', fig.scap='Serpentine stability depth vs. time'}

Numerical experiments in this study suggest a negative dynamic feedback regulating coupling and serpentine dehydration can help explain how similar configurations, in terms of depths to subducting plates beneath arcs [@england2004] and thin upper-plates [@currie2006], may occur in subduction zones with different thermo-kinematic boundary conditions and subduction durations. The results indicate that subduction zones quickly (< 5 Ma) develop and stabilize quasi-permanent, generalized configurations with coupling depth dependent on upper-plate thickness.

Notable exceptions occur in models with the thinnest upper-plates ($Z_{UP}$ = 46 km). Rapid extension due to thin upper-plates form spreading centers in the upper-plate within 5 Ma. Passive asthenospheric upwelling near spreading centers diverts heat from deep within the upper-plate mantle. Enough heat is apparently diverted to disrupt thermal feedbacks regulating coupling and serpentine stability near the plate interface. In principle, diversion of heat from the plate interface could lead to cooler conditions, deeper serpentine stability, and thus deeper coupling. Further testing to confirm this behavior may artificially increase upper-plate strength in thin upper-plate thickness experiments to prevent high rates of spreading.

# Regression Summaries {#regSummary}

The form of the preferred quadratic regression model in Section \@ref(cdEstimators) (Figure \@ref(fig:results) & Table \@ref(tab:zcResults)) implies a lower limit to coupling depth of approximately 60 km, even for thin upper-plate thickness and, presumably, under warm conditions during nascent subduction. In principle, thin upper-plates could allow effective heat transfer in a flowing shallow asthenospheric mantle---hindering deep stabilization of serpentine. Olivine and pyroxene would be the stable mantle minerals, and strong, shallow coupling between plates would be expected @gerya2008. However, even the warmest numerical experiments (low-$\Phi$ & thin upper-plate thickness) in this study eventually stabilize serpentine in the shallow upper-plate mantle. This is evident by increasing depth of mechanical coupling with time for the first 5 Ma of subduction (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)).

Here we discuss only the hydrodynamic model, because it is the most relevant aspect of the numerical experiments.

Hydrodynamics in the numerical models control the timing and magnitude of mantle wedge hydration. The main sources of water delivered to the mantle are altered basaltic crust and seafloor sediments, which we assumed to contain up to 5 $wt.\% H_{2}O$. We assumed a gradual expulsion of water from pore space and through quasi-continuous dehydration reactions occurring within the slab. Water content is computed using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
  \chi_{H_{2}O} = \chi_{H_{2}O_{init}}\times\left(1-\frac{\Delta z}{150\times 10^{3}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\chi_{H_{2}O_{init}}$ = 5 $wt.\%$ and $\Delta z$ is a marker's depth below the topographical surface.

If a rock marker dehydrates, an independent water particle is instantaneously generated at the same location with the respective $H_{2}O$ content. The new water particle is moved in accordance to the local velocity field, described by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vec{v}_{\text{water}} & = (\vec{v}_x,\ \vec{v}_z) \\
    \vec{v}_z & = \vec{v}_z - \vec{v}_{z(\text{percolation})} \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{v}_{water}$ is the velocity vector of the water particle, $\vec{v}_{x}$ and $\vec{v}_{z}$ are the local velocity vectors of the solid state mantle or crust, and $\vec{v}_{z(percolation)}$ is a imposed constant upward percolation velocity (10 $cm/year$). We implicitly neglect kinetics of reactions, as material properties of markers change instantaneously at equilibrium reactions.

# Rheologic Sensitivity Tests on Plate Coupling {#rheologicSensitivity}

Numerical modelling practitioners simulating subduction zones approach mechanical coupling between plates differently. A simple, but highly effective approach, is prescribing a layer of arbitrary strength extending from the surface to an arbitrary depth or temperature along the plate interface. This approach effectively inhibits transfer of shear stress between plates and is analogous to controlling a no-slip condition at the interface (plates move with the same velocity vector beyond the coupling point). Numerous models use this method [e.g. @peacock1996; @peacock1999b; @wada2009; @syracuse2010] in part because it allows fine-tuning to specific subduction zone configurations. Serpentine-or talc-rich horizons are typically invoked to justify implementing such a condition at shallow interface depths.

The experiments outlined in Section \@ref(numMethods) do not explicitly define coupling, but rather use a rheologic model that explicitly follows experimentally determined flow laws and mineral stability fields. This approach conceptually follows and extends petrologic explanations for a weak interface [@hyndman2003; @peacock1999a]. As a corollary, dehydration of serpentine, or possibly talc, at higher temperatures must strengthen the interface [@agard2016]. Noting that talc is unstable at P > 2.0 GPa in an ultramafic rock [@schmidt1998], a serpentine rheology is arguably the most relevant candidate responsible for a strength increase, and thus coupling, at PT conditions inferred for coupling in active subduction zones [@wada2009; @syracuse2010].

Sensitivity tests of the rheologic model presented in Section \@ref(rheologicModel) were run using diverse experiments adjusting the rheology of serpentine (compared to Table \@ref(tab:materials)), the shape and position of the antigorite-out reaction (compared to \@ref(eq:antstab)), and certain hydrodynamic parameters. For brevity, these results are not presented here. The experiments included:

1. antigorite $\leftarrow$ wet olivine flow law
2. antigorite and wet olivine $\leftarrow$ dry olivine flow law
3. isothermal antigorite reaction at 690 ˚C
4. antigorite reaction isothermal Clapeyron slope at 715 ˚C
5. antigorite reaction with positive linear Clapeyron slope
6. linear release of $H_{2}O$ with depth
7. no fluid-induced weakening

Only experiments 5 and 7 listed above were inconsistent with the results presented Section \@ref(Results). Experiment 5 results in transient coupling depths and discontinuous antigorite stability in the upper-plate mantle, whereas experiment 7 results in two-sided subduction [e.g. @gerya2008]. These sensitivity experiments imply numerical coupling mechanisms are mostly contingent on fluid flux to the upper-plate mantle and the implementation of serpentine stability. The experiments also show coupling is relatively insensitive to the exact flow law parameters.
